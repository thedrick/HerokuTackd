============

Great work overall! You seem to have a clear idea of how you will proceed in terms of the website layout, database models, and your goals for the First Sprint. I would advise you to focus on implementing your specified features, such as Twitter-based login, first before spicing up the UI. By the end, your website needs to look professional, but for now (and for the Sprints), make sure that you get the functionality all up and running first. Also, since this is a three-person group, I would say that it isn't a stretch to get Twitter-related features working with the website (although Twitter tack might be a bit difficult), especially since most of the other features seem to be spin-offs of Grumblr features.
