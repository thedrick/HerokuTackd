Use this repository for all of your final course project work.

We will place our feedback to you in the feedback directory.
You should create any other directories needed for your final project.

Graders:

Please look in the mockups directory for initial HTML mockups and drawings of other views. Open the corkboard.html file in your browser to view the home screen HTML mockup. The mockup1.jpg and mockup2.jpg images are just pencil drawings of other views. Also click on the “Add A Board” tack on the cork board in corkboard.html to view the create a board pop over view. The scripts directory contains a very rough python script to grab the most “relevant” photo from a given webpage. This will be used in our implementation of the metadata parser. The descriptions directory contains the multiple files requested for our detailed proposal including the sprint goals, the overall functionality of the site, and the model descriptions. The tackd directory contains the initial Django project and application. This includes the twython-django library to be used in our model for Twitter OAuth and users.
